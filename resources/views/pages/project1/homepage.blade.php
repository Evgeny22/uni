            <p>Science is everywhere! You can see it in the classroom when children build structures in the block area. You can find it in the sticky mess from a childâ€™s melted Popsicle. You can feel it with the changing temperature as winter approaches.</p>

            <p>The early science initiative is about leveraging these naturally occurring science experiences to promote high-quality teaching and learning in early childhood classrooms.</p>
